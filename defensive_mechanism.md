**Regularly restarting network devices**
- Implementing measures to restart network devices on at least a monthly basis can assist in maintaining network device performance as well as removing an adversary that may have compromised a network device but failed to gain persistence.

- Network devices are restarted on at least a monthly basis.


It is generally recommended to reboot no more than 10-20% of the total number of hosts in the network at any given time. This will help minimize the impact of the reboot on the overall network performance. Additionally, it is important to stagger the reboots so that the network devices are not all restarted at the same time.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53, organizations should "limit the number of devices rebooted at one time to no more than 10-20 percent of the total number of devices in the network." You can find more information in the NIST Special Publication 800-53, which is available online
